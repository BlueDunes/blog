I"œ<p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is an open source app that helps you create a second brain based on a local folder of plain text markdown files.
I have been using this tool for a while and I love it. I use it to manage my daily and weekly tasks, to track habits, to take notes, to store cooking recipes and much more.</p>

<p>Today I am going to share how I solved a small issue that I encountered when copying and pasting images to my vault. When you take a screen shot and paste the image to one of your notes, Obsidian adds the image file to your vault and creates an embedded link in your note. This is something I find myself doing very often.</p>
